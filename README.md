I turn my data science workflow into R packages, and I use my R packages to enhance my data science workflow. It is a coherent cycle. 

### R Packages and Featured Software 📦

- {[tidyEmoji](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/tidyEmoji)} - Discovers Emoji from Text
- {[ggchangepoint](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/ggchangepoint)} - Combines Changepoint Analysis with 'ggplot2'
- {[ggDoubleHeat](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/ggDoubleHeat)} - A heatmap-like visualization tool
- {[worlddatajoin](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/worlddatajoin)} - Join 'WDI', 'countrycode', and the World Map Together

And many more packages to come!

### R for Data Science Interaction

I participate the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project weekly by visualizing the data and then tweeting
the visualizations. You can check out the code at {[TidyTuesdayWork](https://github.com/PursuitOfDataScience/TidyTuesdayWork)} and view
the visualizations at my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PursuitOfDS), where I showcase them. 

Also, I do write data science blogs and post them on my website. You can check them out [here](https://youzhi.netlify.app/).
